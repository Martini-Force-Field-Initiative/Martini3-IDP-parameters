# Supporting scripts and data for "Martini3-IDP: Improved Martini 3 Force Field for Disordered Proteins"

## DEPRECATION UPDATE JULY 2025

The contents of this repository has been fully integrated into both [Vermouth-Martinize](https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize)
and [Polyply](https://github.com/marrink-lab/polyply_1.0/). The tutorials detailed in [force_field/readme.md](force_field/readme.md) are deprecated.
In both programs, the force field described in the files here and the associated publication can be specified using `-lib martini3idp` (polyply) or `-ff martini3idp` (martinize2).
If you encounter problems with either implementation, open an issue in the respective repository.

In the case of martinize2, the program now handles disordered regions using the `-id-regions` and `-idr-tune` flags. No customised version
of Vermouth-Martinize is necessary to annotate these regions as previously described, and is _strongly_ discouraged.
