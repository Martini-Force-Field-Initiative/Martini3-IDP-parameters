### Multidomain protein sysmtes incoporating both structured domains and IDRs for validation of the diverse interplay between structured domains and IDRs.
#### Three different interplays:
- ##### non-specific entropy effect from IDR linker conformation entropy - CTPR
  - contact files with different linker and temperature are provided.

- ##### specific electrostatic attraction between structured surface and IDRs - A1
  - contact files between structured domain and IDR tail.
  - Rg evolution and blocking analysis for Rg.

- ##### dynamic protien complex confered by IDR introduciton - CXCL12+HMGB1
  - contact files between CXCL12 and HMGB1 with/without HMGB1 acidic IDR tail, in triplicate simulations.
